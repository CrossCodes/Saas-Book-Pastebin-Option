# LSP-compliant solution: replace inheritance with delegation
# Rubyâ€™s duck typing still lets you use a square in most places where
#  rectangle would be used - but no longer a subclass in LSP sense.
class Square
 attr_accessor :rect
 def initialize(side, top_left)
   @rect = Rectangle.new(side, side, top_left)
 end
 def area      ; rect.area      ; end
 def perimeter ; rect.perimeter ; end
 # A more concise way to delegate, if using ActiveSupport (see text):
 #  delegate :area, :perimeter, :to => :rect
 def side=(s) ; rect.width = rect.height = s ; end
end
